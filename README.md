# Anime Watchlist
My very first CRUD React app

Store lists of anime you've watched, watching, or in your waitlist.

The main storage of this app is just the localstorage of the browser. I use Jikan.moe api for the dataset of anime.

Features:
 - Save an anime to a preferred category 
    - Waitlist
    - Watching
    - Finished
    - Dropped
 - Delete stored anime in a list
 - Move an anime from one list to another
 - See the top 100 anime and other categories in the homepage
