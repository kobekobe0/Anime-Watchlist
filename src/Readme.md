This is my second react app.

I focused on using react hooks. All of the storing/saving and deleting functionalities uses react hooks. Mainly:
-useContext
-useState

For the component styling I used react-bootstrap, material-ui, react icons .

These are the other libraries I used:
-react-router-dom: routing
-Axios: fetching data from API
-Jikan.moe: API

I know that the code structure is not that great,tho, I tried making this clean as I could. I'm looking on refractoring this once I gather knowledge in doing so.
